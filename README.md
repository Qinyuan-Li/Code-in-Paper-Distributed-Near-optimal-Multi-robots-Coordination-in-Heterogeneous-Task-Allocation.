## Codes for Figure 5-3: Performances with monotonic function
"main_gen_cap.ipynb": run and save the results of those algorithms. Increase task number. <br />
“view_gen_cap.ipynb”: draw the figures. <br />
“general_cap_thesis”: data used in thesis (get from “main_gen_cap.ipynb”, and draw by “view_gen_cap.ipynb”). <br />

## Codes for Figure 5-4: Performances with random function
"main_RF0.ipynb": run and save the results of those algorithms. Increase task number. <br />
“view_RF.ipynb”: draw the figures. <br />
“gen_RF_thesis”: data used in thesis (get from “main_RF0.ipynb”, and draw by “view_RF.ipynb”).

## Codes for Figure 5-5: Insight into the intermediate system utilities and Figure 5-6: The messages passed in each iteration.
"cap-mono.ipynb": run and save the results of a single run (with monotonic utility function). <br />
"RF_mono.ipynb": run and save the results of a single run (with random utility function). <br />
“view_mono.ipynb”: draw the figures. <br />
“cap_mono00”: data used in thesis (get from “cap-mono.ipynb”, and draw by “view_mono.ipynb”). <br />
“mono_RF00”: data used in thesis (get from “RF_mono.ipynb”, and draw by “view_mono.ipynb”).
